## Contributing

### pre-commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) so, after installing it, please install the already configured pre-commit hooks we support, to enable pre-commit in your local git repository:

```shell
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

To understand more about the hooks we use, please take a look at pre-commit's [configuration file](./.pre-commit-config.yml).

## Backports

This project requires backports to the existing active branches. Those branches are defined in the `.backportrc.json` and `.mergify.yml` files. In order to do so,
there are two different approaches:

### Mergify ðŸ¥‡

This is the preferred approach. Backports are created automatically as long as the rules defined in [.mergify.yml](.mergify.yml) are fulfilled. From the user's point of
view it's required only to attach a labels to the pull request that should be backported, and once it gets merged the automation happens under the hood.

### Backportrc ðŸ‘´

This is the traditional approach where the backports are created by the author who created the original pull request. For such, it's required to install
[backport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backport) and run the command in your terminal

```bash
$ backport  --label <YOUR_LABELS> --auto-assign --pr <YOUR_PR>
```
