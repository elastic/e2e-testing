@backend_processes
Feature: Backend Processes
  Scenarios for the Elastic Agent verifying backend processes are started and stopped after elastic-agent.

@install
Scenario Outline: Deploying the <os> agent
  Given a "<os>" agent is deployed to Fleet with "tar" installer
  When the "elastic-agent" process is in the "started" state on the host
  Then the "filebeat" process is in the "started" state on the host
    And the "metricbeat" process is in the "started" state on the host

@centos
Examples: Centos

@debian
Examples: Debian

@enroll
Scenario Outline: Deploying the <os> agent with enroll and then run on rpm and deb
  Given a "<os>" agent is deployed to Fleet with "systemd" installer
  When the "elastic-agent" process is in the "started" state on the host
  Then the "filebeat" process is in the "started" state on the host
    And the "metricbeat" process is in the "started" state on the host

@stop-agent
Scenario Outline: Stopping the <os> agent stops backend processes
  Given a "<os>" agent is deployed to Fleet with "tar" installer
  When the "elastic-agent" process is "stopped" on the host

@unenroll
Scenario Outline: Un-enrolling the <os> agent stops backend processes
  Given a "<os>" agent is deployed to Fleet with "tar" installer
  When the agent is un-enrolled
  Then the "elastic-agent" process is in the "started" state on the host
    And the "filebeat" process is in the "stopped" state on the host
    And the "metricbeat" process is in the "stopped" state on the host

@centos
Examples: Centos
| os     |
| centos |

@debian
Examples: Debian
| os     |

@reenroll
Scenario Outline: Re-enrolling the <os> agent starts the elastic-agent process
  Given a "<os>" agent is deployed to Fleet with "tar" installer
    And the agent is un-enrolled
    And the "elastic-agent" process is "stopped" on the host
  When the agent is re-enrolled on the host
  Then the "elastic-agent" process is "started" on the host

@centos
Examples: Centos
| os     |
| centos |

@uninstall-host
Scenario Outline: Un-installing the installed <os> agent
  Given a "<os>" agent is deployed to Fleet with "tar" installer

  Then the "elastic-agent" process is in the "stopped" state on the host
    And the "filebeat" process is in the "stopped" state on the host
    And the "metricbeat" process is in the "stopped" state on the host

@deploy-endpoint-then-unenroll-agent
Scenario Outline: Un-enrolling Elastic Agent stops Elastic Endpoint
  Given an Endpoint is successfully deployed with a "<os>" Agent using "tar" installer
  When the agent is un-enrolled
  Then the "elastic-endpoint" process is in the "stopped" state on the host
