@vsphere
Feature: vSphere
  As a Metricbeat developer I want to check that the vSphere module works as expected

Scenario Outline: Check vSphere-<vsphere_version> is sending metrics to Elasticsearch without errors
  Given vSphere "<vsphere_version>" is running for metricbeat
    And metricbeat is installed and configured for vSphere module
    And metricbeat waits "120" seconds for the service
  When metricbeat runs for "20" seconds
  Then there are "vSphere" events in the index
    And there are no errors in the index
Examples:
| vsphere_version |
| latest          |
