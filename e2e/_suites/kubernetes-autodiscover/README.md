# Observability Helm charts End-To-End tests

## Motivation

Kubernetes autodiscover is a key feature of any observability solution for this
orchestrator, resources change dynamically and observers configurations have to
adapt to these changes.
Discovery of resources in Kubernetes poses some challenges, there are several
corner cases that need to be handled, that involve keeping track of changes of
state that are not always deterministic. This complicates the implementation and
its testing. With lack of good test coverage and many cases to cover, it is easy to
introduce regressions even in basic use cases.
This suite covers a set of use cases that are better tested with real Kubernetes
implementations.

## How do the tests work?

At the topmost level, the test framework uses a BDD framework written in Go, where
we set the expected behavior of use cases in a feature file using Gherkin, and
implementing the steps in Go code.

`kubectl` is used to configure resources in a Kubernetes cluster. `kind` can be
used to provide a local cluster.

The tests will follow this general high-level approach:

1. It uses `kubectl` to interact with a Kubernetes cluster.
1. If there is no configured Kubernetes cluster in kubectl, a new one
   is deployed using `kind`. If a cluster is created, it is also removed after
   the suite is executed.
1. Execute BDD steps representing each scenario. Each scenario is executed in a
   different Kubernetes namespace, so it is easier to cleanup and avoid one
   scenarios affecting the others. These namespaces are created and destroyed
   before and after each scenario.
1. New scenarios can be configured providing the Gherkin definition and
   templatized Kubernetes manifests.

### Adding new scenarios

Scenarios defined in this suite are based in a sequence of actions and
expectations defined in the feature files, and in some templates of resources to
deploy in Kubernetes. Templates are stored in `testdata/templates`, and must
have the `.yml.tmpl` extension.

Several of the available steps can be parameterized with template names, these
names can be written as the name of the template without the extension. Spaces
in these names are replaced with hyphens.

There are steps intended to define a desired state for the resources in the
template, such as the following ones:
* `"filebeat" is running` deploys the template `filebeat.yml.tmpl` and waits for
  filebeat pods to be running. This step expects some pod to be labeled with
  `k8s-app:filebeat`.
* `"a service" is deployed` deploys the resources in the template
  `a-service.yml.tmpl`, and continues without expecting any state of the
  deployed resources.
* `"a pod" is deleted` deletes the resources defined in the template
  `a-pod.yml.tmpl`.

Any of these steps can be parameterized with an option that can be used to
select different configuration blocks in the template. For example the following
step would select the configuration block marked as `monitor annotations` in
the template:
```shell
  `"a service" is deployed with "monitor annotations"
```

These option blocks can be defined in the template like this:
```yaml
meta:
  annotations:
{{ if option "monitor annotations" }}
    co.elastic.monitor/type: tcp
    co.elastic.monitor/hosts: "${data.host}:6379"
{{ end }}
```

Steps defining expectations are mostly based in checking the events generated by
the deployed observers. Steps available for that are like the following ones:
* `"filebeat" collects events with "kubernetes.pod.name:a-pod"` checks that the
  filebeat pod has collected at least one event with the field
  `kubernetes.pod.name` set to a `pod`.
* `"metricbeat" does not collect events with "kubernetes.pod.name:a-pod" during "30s"`
  expects to have a period of time of 30 seconds without collecting events with
  the given field and value.

These steps expect to find the events in the `/tmp/beats-events` file in pods marked
with the label `k8s-app`.

There are other more specific steps. Examples for them can be found in the
feature files.


### Diagnosing test failures

The first step in determining the exact failure is to try and reproduce the test run
locally, ideally using the DEBUG log level to enhance the log output. Once you've
done that, look at the output from the test run.

### Running the tests

1. Clone this repository, say into a folder named `e2e-testing`.

   ``` shell
   git clone git@github.com:elastic/e2e-testing.git
   ```

2. Configure the version of the tools you want to test (Optional).

This is an example of the optional configuration:

   ```shell
   # Depending on the versions used,
   export BEAT_VERSION=7.12.0 # version of beats to use
   export BEATS_USE_CI_SNAPSHOTS=true # to select snapshots built by beats-ci
   export KUBERNETES_VERSION="1.18.2" # version of the cluster to be passed to kind
   ```

3. Install dependencies.

   - Install Kubectl 1.18 or newer
   - Install Kind 0.10.0 or newer
   - Install Go, using the language version defined in the `.go-version` file at the root directory. We recommend using [GVM](https://github.com/andrewkroh/gvm), same as done in the CI, which will allow you to install multiple versions of Go, setting the Go environment in consequence: `eval "$(gvm 1.15.9)"`
   - Install godog (from project's root directory): `make -C e2e install-godog`

4. Run the tests.
   ```shell
   cd e2e/_suites/kubernetes-autodiscover
   OP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG go test -v
   ```

   Optionally, you can run only one of the feature files
   ```shell
   cd e2e/_suites/kubernetes-autodiscover
   OP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG go test -v --godog.tags='@filebeat'
   ```

   The tests will take a few minutes to run, spinning up the Kubernetes cluster
   if needed.

### Problems with the environment

If a Kubernetes cluster is pre-configured in kubectl, you can directly use this
command to investigate the resources deployed in the cluster by the suite. If
the cluster was deployed by the suite, it will have a randomized name, and will
use a temporary configuration file for kubectl.

The name of the cluster can be obtained with `kubectl get clusters`, clusters
created by this suite will follow the pattern `kind-<random uuid>`.

The temporary configuration file is logged by the suite at the info level. If a
cluster is created by the suite, you will see something like this:
```shell
INFO[0000] Kubernetes cluster not available, will start one using kind
INFO[0000] Using kind v0.10.0 go1.15.7 linux/amd64
INFO[0046] Kubeconfig in /tmp/test-252418601/kubeconfig
```

Then you could use the following command to control the resources with
`kubectl`:
```shell
kubectl --kubeconfig /tmp/test-252418601/kubeconfig ...
```

Each scenario creates its own namespace, you can find them with `kubectl get
ns`, they will follow the pattern `test-<random uuid>`.

Interrupting the tests with Ctrl-C will leave all resources as they were, you
can use the previous instructions to investigate problems or access to logs of
the deployed pods.
